                🤭, don’t look at me now oo, you know what I mean 😏. As you add
                +1 today unto your former age, I pray that the Lord will

                remain happy and filled with joy knowing that it shall be well,

                It’s been an amazing time with you, despite the turbulences and
                shaky-emotions, I think I’m right to say it’s really been an
                amazing thing to experience it with you baby. I tend to
                recognize all of this as part of being together, we have really
                come a long way , perhaps half a long way🤔, anyways both still
                stands as time in which both of us as spent together. it’s
                hasn’t been easy, considering our distance but despite it we
                keep moving forward, and that’s the goal. I want to thank you
                for the support and steadiness you have brought to our
                relationship although the emotions is a bit high 🤭, I’m still
                grateful for what’ you have been showing and putting as well. It
                takes two to tango , and we are sure Tangoing despite the
                challenges. I still love you despite all these turbulences, I
                know I have said in past days how my emotions has been weak, but
                if you look at it t closely, they weren’t even weak it was just
                my minds weakness but not the feelings I have for you. In all
                this I still want you as mine and none other . I still want to
                be a part of you in the best way I can ❤️. <br /><br />

                really do flies . For me it’s as though we just started
                yesterday 🤭, all parts of you make me tickle and you know they
                do 😏. I have missed quite a lot, your touch, the warm cuddles ,
                the going outs, the close affection and talks, the Segs 🤭, and
