      <h1>Happy Birthday/Anniversary baby ❤️🎊</h1>
      <p>
        Going further to expatiate more on this writing ✍️, I would like to wish
        you a heartfelt happy birthday or should i say big 24 🤭, don’t look at
        me now oo, you know what I mean 😏. As you add +1 today unto your former
        age, I pray that the Lord will continue to see you through in all you do
        babe, May you always remain happy and filled with joy knowing that it
        shall be well, May God guide your paths as you embark on all journeys of
        life this Mother Earth as to offer, May you succeed in all your
        endeavors and that which you put your heart and efforts into.…(Amen
        🙏).<br /><br />

        It’s been an amazing time with you, despite the turbulences and
        shaky-emotions, I think I’m right to say it’s really been an amazing
        thing to experience it with you baby. I tend to recognize all of this as
        part of being together, we have really come a long way, perhaps half a
        long way🤔, anyways both still stands as time in which both of us as
        spent together. it’s hasn’t been easy, considering our distance but
        despite it we keep moving forward, and that’s the goal. I want to thank
        you for the support and steadiness you have brought to our relationship
        although the emotions are a bit high 🤭, I’m still grateful for what you
        have been showing and putting as well. It takes two to tango, and we are
        sure Tangoing despite the challenges. I still love you despite all these
        turbulences, I know I have said in past days how my emotions have been
        weak, but if you look at it closely, they weren’t even weak it was just
        my mind's weakness but not the feelings I have for you. In all this, I
        still want you as mine and none other. I still want to be a part of you
        in the best way I can ❤️.<br /><br />

        Today will make it a year of us being together, phew 😮‍💨, time really
        does fly. For me, it’s as though we just started yesterday 🤭, all parts
        of you make me tickle and you know they do 😏. I have missed quite a
        lot, your touch, the warm cuddles, the going outs, the close affection
        and talks, the Segs 🤭, and quite more… I can’t wait to recollect these
        memories once more with you. I pray for more years of us together 🫂 and
        I still want to cherish more memories and moments with you. I love the
        momentum at which we keep going, and we should keep doing so Everly and
        also progressing in all which we want to change amongst us.<br /><br />

        I love you baby 🥰, and I want to wish you a happy birthday once more,
        I’m proud of you ❤️.<br /><br />

        Yours lovely, Chef ❤️.
